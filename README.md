# Bike-Project-Using-Sql-and-PowerBi

Data Analysis Wokflow:
->Developing Sql Queries
->Connecting Powerbi to DB
->Building a dashboard in PowerBi

Objective:
Developing a dashboard that displays key performance metrics for the decision making.

Requirements:
-	Hourly Revenue Analysis
-	Profit and Revenue Trends
-	Seasonal Revenue
-	Rider Demographics

Recommendations:
Considering the substantial increase in pricing last year, it is prudent to adopt a more conservative approach for this year. To avoid significant customer loss while responding to market dynamics, it is advisable to implement a moderate price increase. A suggested increase in the range of 10% to 15% would allow for effective market response without risking substantial loss of customers.
For instance, if the current price is $4.99:
- A 10% increase would adjust the price to approximately $5.49.
- A 15% increase would adjust the price to approximately $5.74.
Recommended Strategy:
1. Market Analysis:
   - Conduct further analysis to gauge customer satisfaction, monitor potential competitive changes, and assess the overall economic environment. This will guide whether the increase should lean towards the lower or higher end of the suggested range.
2. Segmented Pricing Strategy:
   - Consider implementing different pricing strategies for casual versus registered users, as they may exhibit different price sensitivities.
3. Implementation and Monitoring:
   - Introducing the new prices, but we need to be prepared to make adjustments based on immediate customer feedback. Closely monitoring customer reactions to ensure the pricing strategy is effective and make necessary changes to avoid prices that may turn out to be too high.
